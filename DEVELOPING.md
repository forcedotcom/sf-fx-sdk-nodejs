## Pre-requisites

1.  We are using Node 8+. If you need to work with multiple versions of Node, you might consider using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
1.  This repository uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage node dependencies. Please install yarn globally using `npm install --global yarn`.

## Typical workflow

You would only do this once after you cloned the repository.

1.  Clone this repository from git.
1.  `cd` into `sf-fx-sdk-nodejs`.
1.  We develop on the `develop` branch and release from the `master` branch. At
    this point, you should do initiate a `git checkout -t origin/develop`.
1.  `yarn` to bring in all the top-level dependencies.
1.  Open the project in your editor of choice.

When you are ready to commit

1.  Before commit and push, husky will run several hooks to ensure the message and that everything lints and compiles properly.

## List of Useful commands

### `yarn compile`

This compiles the typescript to javascript.

### `yarn clean`

This cleans all generated files and directories. Run `yarn clean-all` will also clean up the node_module directories.

### `yarn test`

This tests the typescript using ts-node.

### `yarn lint`

This lists all the typescript. If there are no errors/warnings
from tslint, then you get a clean output. But, if they are errors from tslint,
you will see a long error that can be confusing â€“ just focus on the tslint
errors. The results of this is deeper than what the tslint extension in VS Code
does because of [semantic lint
rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/type-checking/) which requires a
tsconfig.json to be passed to tslint.

## Release process

* Make sure version is correct in package.json - of not, create PR for that, get it reviewed and merged
* make sure local `master` branch is up-to-date and has target commit(s):
```
    git checkout master && git pull origin master && git fetch -p
    git log  # check for desired commits
```
* Do a full clean build and test, ensure there are no errors:
```
    yarn clean-all
    yarn
    yarn build
    yarn test
```
* Create and push tag for release:
```
git tag v1.4.0
git push origin --tags
```
* on github, create release with that tag: https://github.com/forcedotcom/sf-fx-sdk-nodejs/tags (... Edit Release or Create Release)
* Make sure you are a member of the salesforce org on npmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/~MY_USERNAME under the Organizations tab
* Make sure npm account is enabled for *2-factor authorization and publishing* at https://www.npmjs.com/settings/MY_USERNAME/profile.  If not, set that up and enable it (should be required as part of being in the salesforce org)
* Log into yarn and publish according to the docs at https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/publishing-a-package/
```
yarn login
yarn publish
# when prompted for New Version, just hit Return
# you should then be prompted for your MFA 6-digit token that was set up as part of 2-factor auth
# then if all goes well, the new version is published
```
